## Welcome to my GitHub Page

I currently plan on using this service for hosting Privacy Policies for published apps, but may extend my page to accomodate projects as needed.

### Published Apps
#### Santa's Cap
This app is a simple tool I developed for iMessage. Its current usage is limited to inviting friends to a group, and assigning group members partners to buy gifts for. That being said, I intend to extend its functionality to include a Planner tool, which will let users fill out a calendar and "vote" on a date for the event to be held.

This app has been my biggest project to-date, and allowed me to work with:
  * UI/ Auto Layout
  * The Apple Messages framework (sending data in NSURL objects, view presentation styles...)
  * Multi-View Applications
  * and many more intricacies of Swift 4 and platform-nonspecific programming

#### Seta Stickers
This app was my first take at iOS development. It is a simple sticker pack, but it helped familiarize me with Xcode's Interface Builder, the Apple Developer Program, the process of code-signing/ preparing a build/ publishing an app, and Adobe CC (Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate).
