## Welcome to my GitHub Page

I currently plan on using this service for hosting Privacy Policies for published apps, but may extend my page to accomodate projects as needed.

### Published Apps
##### Santa's Cap
* This app is a simple tool I developed for iMessage. Its current usage is limited to inviting friends to a group, and assigning group members partners to buy gifts for. That being said, I intend to extend its functionality to include a Planner tool, which will let users fill out a calendar and "vote" on a date for the event to be held.
